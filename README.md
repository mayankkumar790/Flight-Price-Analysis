## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a flight price dataset to uncover the key factors influencing airline ticket pricing.

The objective of this analysis is to:
- Understand pricing patterns
- Identify important features affecting ticket prices
- Extract meaningful business insights
- Prepare data for predictive modeling

---

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains flight booking details including:

- Airline
- Flight Code
- Source & Destination Cities
- Departure & Arrival Time
- Number of Stops
- Travel Duration
- Days Left for Departure
- Ticket Class (Business/Economy)
- Ticket Price (Target Variable)

---

## 🛠 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

The following steps were performed:

✔ Handled missing values  
✔ Converted date columns into numerical features (Day, Month, Year)  
✔ Cleaned time-related columns  
✔ Transformed categorical features  
✔ Mapped total stops into numerical values  
✔ Prepared dataset for visualization and modeling

## 📊 Visualizations Created

Seven business-focused visualizations were developed:

1. 📈 Price Distribution Histogram  
2. 📊 Average Price by Airline  
3. 📦 Total Stops vs Price (Boxplot)  
4. 📅 Monthly Price Trend  
5. 🗺 Top 10 Most Frequent Routes  
6. ⏱ Duration vs Price (Scatter Plot)  
7. 🔥 Correlation Heatmap  

Each visualization highlights important pricing behavior and demand trends.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Non-stop flights are generally more expensive due to convenience factor.
- Ticket prices increase with flight duration.
- Certain airlines operate in a premium pricing segment.
- Seasonal demand significantly impacts ticket pricing.
- Duration and total stops show noticeable correlation with price.
- High-demand routes contribute significantly to airline revenue.

---

## 📈 Business Recommendations

- Airlines can apply premium pricing for non-stop flights.
- Dynamic pricing strategies should be implemented during peak months.
- High-demand routes should be prioritized for revenue optimization.
- Duration and stops should be key features in predictive pricing models.
